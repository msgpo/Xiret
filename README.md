# Xiret
This application was written as the Windows Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Version 1 was never published as open-source.
Current version is RC stage 1. Some items are currently missing and will be uploaded when finished.

# Key features
 - Clean and friendly UI
 - Easily export scores as image or text
 - Imgur API for simple uploading (API key needed)
 - Full DPI support
 - Normal and Verbose modes
 - Made with portability in mind
 - Windows Vista support
 
# Motivation
Initially Xiret was created to pass some time when the Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Since it's growing into V2 I
though 'why not share?' VB isn't too hard to get into and it may help someone learn a thing or two, like I did.
