# Xiret

RC1 > RC2 (Development stage)

## Requested additions  
 - Add option for custom Imgur API key
   - Will be implemented before the V2 release.

## Known Bugs

2. A workaround for Windows 7 missing KB2687862 is currently being implemented.  

## Key features
 - Clean and friendly UI
 - Easily export scores as image or text
 - Imgur API for simple uploading (API key needed)
 - Full DPI support
 - Normal and Verbose modes
 - Made with portability in mind
 - Windows Vista support
 
## Motivation
Initially Xiret was created to pass some time when the Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Since it's growing into V2 I
though 'why not share?' VB isn't too hard to get into and it may help someone learn a thing or two, like I did. Other motivation was anti-virus engines flagging this software as malware, now everyone can see it's guts they know they're safe!
