# Xiret
This program was written as the Windows Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Many applications that imitate the experience index either **a.** Do not work properly, or **b.** Have many adverts, so I created something **stable** and **free**. Version 1 of this project was never published as open-source.

## Key features
 - Clean and friendly UI
 - Easily export scores as image or text
 - Imgur API for simple uploading (API key needed)
 - Full DPI support
 - Normal and Verbose modes
 - Made with portability in mind
 - Windows Vista support

## Current build
RC1 > RC2 (Development stage)

## Requested additions  
 - Add option for custom Imgur API key.
   - Will be implemented before the V2 release.

## Known Bugs
1. Assessments can incorrectly log data, this is due to the way data is handled.  
2. A workaround for Windows 7 missing KB2687862 is currently being implemented. However this is not an issue with Xiret, it's a bug where an async case is not handled in Windows 7.
 
## Motivation
Initially Xiret was created to pass some time when the Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Since it's growing into V2 I
though 'why not share?' VB isn't too hard to get into and it may help someone learn a thing or two, like I did. Other motivation was anti-virus engines flagging this software as malware, now everyone can see it's guts they know they're safe.
