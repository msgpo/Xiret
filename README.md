# Xiret
This program was written as the Windows Experience Index ([WEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_System_Assessment_Tool)) graphic version was removed in Windows 8.1. Many applications that imitate the experience index either do not work properly, or have many adverts, so I created something stable and FOSS. 

Version 1 of this project was never published as open-source.

## Motivation
Initially Xiret was created to pass some time when the Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Since it's growing into V2 I though 'why not share?' Visual basic isn't too hard to get into and it may help someone learn a thing or two, like I did. Other motivation was anti-virus engines flagging this software as malware, now everyone can see its guts they know they're safe.
