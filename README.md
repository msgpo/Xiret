## Motivation
Initially Xiret was created to pass some time when the Experience Index UI was removed in Windows 8.1. Since it's growing into V2 I
though 'why not share?' VB isn't too hard to get into and it may help someone learn a thing or two, like I did. Other motivation was anti-virus engines flagging this software as malware, now everyone can see it's guts they know they're safe!
